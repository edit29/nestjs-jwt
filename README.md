# nestjs-jwt (Pracc-JWT2)

This project is a NestJS backend for a small product-selling app. It includes product management, a simple cart, and a checkout endpoint that can send a product card over WhatsApp using Twilio.

## Quick start

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the values (Postgres, JWT secret, Twilio credentials):

```powershell
copy .env.sample .env
# edit .env
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Generate Prisma client and run migrations (if you use Prisma migrations):

```powershell
npx prisma generate
# npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

4. Start the app in development mode:

```powershell
npm run start:dev
```

5. Test the checkout endpoint (authenticated):

POST /checkout

Body:
```json
{
  "telegramUsername": "@example_user",
  "message": "Please send me the product card"
}
```

Make sure to include an Authorization header with a Bearer JWT from your auth flow.

## Telegram

- If `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set in `.env`, the application will use the Telegram Bot API to send messages to the given username (e.g. `@channelname`).
- Note: bots cannot message arbitrary users unless the user has started the bot; sending to `@username` works for channels / public groups where the bot is a member/admin.

## Tests

Run unit tests with:

```powershell
npm test
```

## Next steps

- Implement payments (Stripe) if you want to accept payments.
- Add e2e tests for authenticated flows.
- Add image upload (S3) and send media via WhatsApp.
